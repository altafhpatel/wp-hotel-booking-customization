# WP Hotel Booking by Thimpress Customization
<strong>Reuirement:</strong>
1. To incorporate hotel listing in their existing website. Initially the website already has custom post types. What i suggest is to install a hotel booking plugin name <strong>WP Hotel Booking by Thimpress</strong> and create single page template.
<strong>Challenge</strong>
1. To fullfill the client we install a plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hotel-booking/>wp-hotel-booking</a> by thimpress.
2. Create a template for single listing page (single-{post-type}.php).
